### pilot_data directory information: 
paper_figures: jupyter notebooks used to create the figures in the submitted manuscript. There is also an R file with the functions used in the jupyter notebooks. RA processed datasets from Weinand et al., Nat Comm, 2024 were obtained from Synapse [syn53650034](https://doi.org/10.7303/syn53650034). COVID-19 processed datasets from Cheong et al., Cell, 2023 were obtained from GEO [GSE196988](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE196nnn/GSE196988/suppl/).


scripts: The scripts used to calculate metrics. Usage information by script can be found by using Rscript {script} -h. Code snippets from [our previous repo](https://github.com/immunogenomics/RA_ATAC_multiome) were also used to generate embeddings.
